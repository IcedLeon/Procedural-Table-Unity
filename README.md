# Procedural-Table
## This is a simple demo showing the procedural creation of a table with chairs in Unity 2018. 

The starting piece of forniture is composed of a 1x1 table with four legs and four chairs. Once in Edit mode, snap points will be visible,  allowing the user to stretch or shrink the table along one direction (X,Y,Z). The app will add one chair for each meter of generated desk, updating the position for every table leg.
